Necessary:
  - Divide sum of colecctor norms by collector count
  - Implement coefficient-based norms (e. g. coefficient of variation)
  - Find reasonable weights for collectors
  - More testing

Optional:
 - Implement auto-binning frequency distribution for numbers
 - Derive multi-phase process from dependency information
